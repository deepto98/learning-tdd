# Learning TDD

Having avoided tests all my life, I guess its finally time to learn what the heck they are, and how to write them. I'm trying to learn TDD (Test Driven Development) by following this playlist - [Test Driven Development (TDD) in Golang](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtFquUj7IL8VpSL98BTvl3lnD8HS4NGlA)


## Steps
1. Test to check if stack is empty. Idea is to write the test first, and implement the actual code along with the tests, with the aim to make tests pass. Command to run tests
2. Rules : Test filename must end with `_test.go`. Every test method must start with `Test` Command to run tests : `go test`
